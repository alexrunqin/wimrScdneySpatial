## Overview

Understanding the interplay between different types of cells and their immediate environment is critical for understanding the mechanisms of cells themselves and their function in the context of human diseases. Recent advances in high dimensional in situ cytometry technologies have fundamentally revolutionized our ability to observe these complex cellular relationships providing an unprecedented characterisation of cellular heterogeneity in a tissue environment.

## Description

In this tutorial we will introduce an analytical framework for analysing data from high dimensional spatial omics technologies such as, CODEX, CycIF, IMC and High Definition Spatial Transcriptomics. This framework makes use of functionality from our Bioconductor packages simpleSeg, FuseSOM, spicyR, lisaClust, and ClassifyR. By the end of this tutorial attendees will be able to implement and assess some of the key steps of a spatial analysis pipeline including cell segmentation, feature normalisation, cell type identification, microenvironment and cell-state characterisation, spatial hypothesis testing and patient classification. Understanding these key steps will provide attendees with the core skills needed to interrogate the comprehensive spatial information generated by these exciting new technologies.
